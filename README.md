# RegAI Copilot
## RAG-Powered Regulatory Intelligence System for Capital Markets

*This project demonstrates product management capabilities through comprehensive documentation and technical design. It represents the frameworks, artifacts, and strategic thinking I would apply when building an AI product for regulatory compliance operations.*

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository showcases my product management approach to building AI-powered solutions for capital markets. It demonstrates:

1.  **Strategic Product Thinking**: User research, problem framing, solution validation
2.  **Technical Depth**: RAG architecture design, API specification, scalability planning
3.  **Execution Rigor**: Agile methodology, prioritization frameworks, stakeholder management
4.  **Domain Expertise**: Deep understanding of capital markets regulatory challenges
5.  **Responsible AI**: Hallucination mitigation, transparency, human oversight

The documentation artifacts represent the work products I would create when leading an AI product initiative. While this repository does not include implementation code, the technical design is sufficiently detailed for an engineering team to build the system.

**Target Audience:**
- Hiring managers assessing AI PM candidates
- Product leaders evaluating product thinking and communication skills
- Technical stakeholders evaluating depth of AI/ML understanding
- Compliance professionals interested in AI applications for regulatory work

## Problem Context

Financial institutions operate under increasingly complex regulatory frameworks. Compliance teams must manually monitor, analyze, and implement rules from dense legal documents across multiple jurisdictions, facing tight deadlines and significant operational risk. This manual process is time-intensive, prone to error, and creates knowledge silos.

Efficient regulatory change management is critical to avoiding enforcement actions and reputational damage.

## Product Vision

The proposed solution is a RAG-based AI system that consolidates regulatory content, enables intelligent search, and provides structured analysis to accelerate compliance workflows.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Centralized Knowledge Base**: Single source of truth for regulatory content.
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Semantic search to surface relevant regulations.
- **Structured Analysis**: AI-assisted extraction of obligations, deadlines, and entities.
- **Change Tracking**: Automated detection of amendments.
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of queries and analyses.
