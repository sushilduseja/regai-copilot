# Persona: Technology/Operations Lead

**Tertiary User / Implementation Partner**

## Demographics
- **Experience**: 8+ years in technology operations, system implementation, or IT project management
- **Background**: Computer science or operations management degree; deep knowledge of internal systems
- **Role**: Lead responsible for implementing regulatory changes in systems (data platforms, trading systems, risk systems, etc.)
- **Reporting**: Reports to Chief Technology Officer or Chief Operations Officer

## Goals
- Receive clear, timely technical requirements from compliance team
- Estimate implementation effort and resource needs accurately
- Plan system changes to meet regulatory enforcement deadlines
- Integrate regulatory changes with ongoing technology roadmap
- Reduce rework from incomplete or late requirement specification
- Manage implementation risk by understanding regulation's technical scope

## Pain Points
- Late notification of regulatory changes limits planning time
- Vague requirements from compliance team require multiple clarification cycles
- Unclear technical scope leads to scope creep and rework
- Difficulty prioritizing regulatory work against business initiatives
- Compliance team unfamiliar with implementation constraints
- No clear deadline visibility until late in cycle (risk of emergency response)

## Technology Comfort
- Deep technical expertise with internal systems, databases, APIs
- Data governance and quality assurance experience
- Project management and resource planning skills
- Cost and effort estimation proficiency

## Success Criteria
- Receives clear technical requirements with 4-6 week advance notice
- Requirements specify which systems are affected and scope of changes
- Reduced implementation rework (first-pass accuracy >80%)
- Better collaboration with compliance through structured documentation
- Ability to forecast resource needs and manage roadmap impact

## Typical Workflow
1. Receives regulatory requirement from compliance team
2. Analyzes impact on internal systems (trading, risk, reporting, etc.) (2-4 hours)
3. Estimates effort and resource requirements (4-8 hours)
4. Works with development teams to implement changes (weeks/months)
5. Tests and validates system changes meet requirement
6. Deploys to production by enforcement date

## Key Needs from RegAI Copilot
- Clear, searchable documentation of which systems must change and why
- Deadline clarity (effective dates, enforcement dates, phase-in periods)
- Technical requirements extraction (e.g., new data fields, calculation methods)
- Version control and change tracking (old vs. new requirements)
- Regulatory obligation-to-system impact mapping
- Historical context on similar prior implementations
