This directory contains visual journey maps documenting user workflows and pain points.

## Current State Journeys

### Regulatory Analyst Workflow (Current State)
**Stages:**
1. **Notification** - Learns of new regulation via email/website subscription
2. **Initial Review** - Reads rule text and summary documents
3. **Research** - Searches for related prior regulations and guidance
4. **Analysis** - Assesses impact on assigned business lines
5. **Documentation** - Writes preliminary assessment with citations
6. **Review** - Submits to manager for quality check and approval

**Current Pain Points (by stage):**
- Notification: Fragmented sources, missed updates
- Initial Review: Document management challenges, dense legal language
- Research: Time-intensive, multiple sources to consult
- Analysis: Difficulty cross-referencing related rules, knowledge gaps
- Documentation: Manual citation tracking, rework from quality feedback
- Review: Manager needs to re-verify work, quality gaps

### Future State Journeys (Post RegAI)

**Regulatory Analyst (Future):**
- Uses RegAI to search and identify related regulations (90% faster)
- Obtains structured impact assessment with citation trail (automated)
- Focuses expertise on judgment calls and stakeholder communication
- Time reduction: 3-5 days → 4-8 hours per regulation

**Compliance Manager (Future):**
- Receives analyst work with machine-generated source documentation
- Quick validation against source documents (15 min vs. 3 hours)
- Increases confidence in coverage and consistency
- Time reduction: 3 hours review → 30 minutes review per regulation

**Technology Lead (Future):**
- Receives clear, structured technical requirements from analyst work
- Systems impact clearly flagged by regulation type/asset class
- Deadline and implementation planning visibility from start
- Planning time: Start of cycle vs. last minute

## Key Improvements

| Metric | Current | Future | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Initial impact assessment time | 3-5 days | 4-8 hours | 80% reduction |
| Manager review time | 3 hours | 30 min | 90% reduction |
| Quality rework rate | 15-20% | <5% | 75% reduction |
| Time to identify systems impact | 2 days after assessment | 4 hours after assessment | 90% reduction |
