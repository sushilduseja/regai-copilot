## Technical Feasibility Study

- **RAG Architecture Evaluation**: An assessment of the suitability of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture for this specific use case, concluding it provides the necessary flexibility and transparency.
- **LLM Benchmarking**: Plan for benchmarking various Large Language Models (LLMs) on domain-specific text to evaluate their reasoning and cost-effectiveness.
- **Technology Stack Assessment**: Evaluation of potential technology choices for each component of the architecture (Vector DB, Job Queues, Caching, etc.).
- **Risk Analysis**: Identification of technical and operational risks, such as LLM hallucinations or low retrieval accuracy, and proposed mitigation strategies.
