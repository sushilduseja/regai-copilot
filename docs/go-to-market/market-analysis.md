## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions & Substitutes

**Traditional Regulatory Monitoring (Substitutes):**
- Manual website monitoring (free but time-intensive)
- Email subscriptions (ESMA news alerts, regulatory newsletters)
- General legal research platforms (Bloomberg Law, Westlaw)

- **Limitation**: No incumbents with strong PMF in regulatory analysis + RAG

### Competitive Advantages (RegAI)

1. **Domain Focus**: Built specifically for regulatory compliance (vs. general legal AI)
2. **RAG Architecture**: Specialized retrieval + grounded generation vs. general LLMs
3. **Citation Transparency**: Mandatory source attribution (audit requirement)
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Compliance professionals remain in control (vs. automation fantasy)
5. **Regulatory-Grade**: Built for audit trails and compliance requirements
