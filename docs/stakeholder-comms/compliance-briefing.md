## Compliance & Legal Briefing

**For:** Compliance, Legal, and Risk Stakeholders

**1. Regulatory Alignment:**
- The system is an **analytical assistant**, not a legal advisor.
- All terms of service will clearly state that the tool does not provide legal advice and that all interpretations must be verified by qualified personnel.

**2. Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards:**
- The core design principle is "human-in-the-loop." The AI provides suggestions and analysis, but the compliance officer makes the final determination.
- All AI-generated outputs are flagged as such and require review.

**3. Audit Trail Capabilities:**
- The system maintains a complete and immutable log of all user queries, documents viewed, and analyses generated.
- This provides a comprehensive audit trail for regulatory examinations.

**4. Liability Limitations:**
- The system's outputs are based on the provided regulatory texts. Liability for final compliance decisions remains with the institution and its qualified professionals.
- We will work with Legal to draft clear liability disclaimers.

**5. Vendor Risk Assessment (LLM APIs):**
- We will conduct a thorough risk assessment of our LLM provider (OpenAI).
- No confidential or client-specific data will be sent to external APIs. User queries can be anonymized before being processed.
